# 1071 x86 Assembly Programming
Assignments from x86 Assembly class. 

# Windows
Windows versions are written in Visual Studio.

# Linux
Linux versions are not a part of assignments. I taught myself x86_64 linux assembly programming by watching [kuapala's great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLetF-YjXm-sCH6FrTz4AQhfH6INDQvQSn) on YouTube. 


Some tools I used:
 
* nasm - a portable 80x86 assembler
* ld - the GNU linker
* make - for building programs
* [syscall table for linux x86_64](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/)
