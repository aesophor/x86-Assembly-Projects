# 1071 x86 Assembly Programming
Assignments from x86 Assembly class. 

# Windows
Windows versions are written under Visual Studio.

# Linux
Linux versions are written for fun. I taught myself x86_64 linux assembly programming by watching [kuapala's great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLetF-YjXm-sCH6FrTz4AQhfH6INDQvQSn) on YouTube. 
Here's a [syscall table for linux x86_64](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/).

* nasm as assembler
* ld as linker

Each of them comes with a Makefile.
